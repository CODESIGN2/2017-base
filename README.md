# CD2 Base PHP Project (Experimental)

This is a 2017 effort to simplify the framework-based approach coming back to basics for PHP applications.

 * No front-controller (at least to start with)
 * Loads Bootstrap / Autoloader before doing anything
 * Configures system

## Motivation(s)

 * Lean approach to systems design
 * Cross-technology approach (something we are trying for 2017)
 * Well documented / tested from beginning
